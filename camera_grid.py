"""
camera_grid.py
================

This script enumerates camera devices (webcams) on your computer and opens
each one concurrently, displaying their live video feeds in a single grid
window. Each feed is labelled with its index number so you can easily
identify which physical camera corresponds to which index. Use this to
discover internal and external video inputs on your machine.

Requirements:
    python -m pip install opencv-python

Usage:
    python camera_grid.py

Press 'q' in the window to exit and release all cameras.

Note:
    The script attempts to open camera indices from 0 up to MAX_CAMS-1. If
    you have more than MAX_CAMS cameras, increase the MAX_CAMS constant. On
    some systems, trying to open indices that don't exist may cause a slight
    delay; this is normal. Only successfully opened cameras will be used.
